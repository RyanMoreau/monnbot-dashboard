# Monnbot Dashboard
Welcome to the Monnbot Dashboard, the official visual interface designed to seamlessly complement the Monnbot CLI. Dive into FTX markets and easily identify funding and cash and carry opportunities without the manual hassle. I've migrated this here from my personal Gitlab repo in hopes someone finds it interesting. Due to the FTX scandal, I've decided to open source a trading system (CLI, Dashboard, & Server) I built to capture funding rates and spreads of cryptocurrency pairs.

## ðŸš€ Features
- *Position Sizing Calculator:* No more manual calculations. Get the ideal position size for your trades instantly.
- *Funding Payout View:* Easily visualize your Profit & Loss (PnL) across different timeframes.
- *Dynamic Rate Updates:* Each time you reload, witness real-time data capturing the current spread and funding rates spanning hourly, 4-hour, daily, and weekly intervals.
- *Live Spread Charts:* Our server is consistently at work, recording the spreads for multiple pairs and securing those metrics in a MongoDB for your analysis.
- *Themes*: Yea, I even had a few themes included ðŸŒ“

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Monnbot Dashboard?
In the volatile world of trading, time is of the essence. The primary goal behind this dashboard is to provide a swift and convenient platform that works in tandem with the monnbot CLI. No more scavenging the market manually â€“ simply launch the dashboard and let the opportunities present themselves.

To validate and cross-check the data, you can always run monnbot to monitor the spread for a few hours before diving into a position. And since there's a tangible correlation between spread and funding rate, opportunities usually come hand-in-hand with attractive spread profits.
